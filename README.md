# 🌍 My Travels

**My Travels** is a React app that allows you to select locations on a map, add notes about them, and keep a record of all the cities and countries you’ve visited.

This project was built to practice using **React Router** for page navigation and the **Context API** for state management. It also integrates interactive maps using the **Leaflet** library.
